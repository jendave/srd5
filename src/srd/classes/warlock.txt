[[otherworldly-patron]]
===== Otherworldly Patron

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of
your choice: the Archfey, <<the-fiend>>, or the Great Old One, each of which
is detailed in "<<otherworldly-patrons>>." Your choice grants you
features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

[[pact-magic]]
===== Pact Magic

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have
given you facility with spells.

[[cantrips-4]]
====== Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You
learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of <<srd.warlock-table>>.

[[spell-slots-3]]
====== Spell Slots

[[srd.warlock-spells-table]]
.Warlock Spell Slots by Level
[format="csv",options="header",grid="none"]
|=================================
include::./tables/warlock-spells.csv[]
|=================================

<<srd.warlock-spells-table>> shows how many spell slots you
have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your
spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of
1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.
To cast the 1st-level spell link:#thunderwave[_thunderwave_], you must
spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

[[spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-3]]
====== Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of <<srd.warlock-table>> shows when you learn more
warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you
choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in <<srd.warlock-spells-table>>'s 
Slot Level column for your level. When you
reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can
be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

[[spellcasting-ability-6]]
====== Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

[[spellcasting-focus-5]]
====== Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock
spells.

[[eldritch-invocations]]
===== Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations
(see "<<eldritch-invocations-1>>"), fragments of
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you
gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your
choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you
could learn at that level.

[[pact-boon]]
===== Pact Boon

At 3rd level, your <<otherworldly-patron>> bestows a gift upon you for your
loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

[[pact-of-the-chain]]
====== Pact of the Chain

You learn the _find familiar_ spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your
own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with
its reaction.

[[pact-of-the-blade]]
====== Pact of the Blade

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You
can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create
it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for
1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if
you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a
special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over
the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can
then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and
it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't
affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases
being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a
different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to
it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional
space when the bond breaks.

[[pact-of-the-tome]]
====== Pact of the Tome

Your <<otherworldly-patron>> gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain
this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the
three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person,
you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your
number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell
list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to
receive a replacement from your <<otherworldly-patron>>. This ceremony can be performed
during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.

[[ability-score-improvement-10]]
===== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

[[mystic-arcanum]]
===== Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your <<otherworldly-patron>> bestows upon you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this
arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You
must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can
be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain
all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

[[eldritch-master]]
===== Eldritch Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power
while entreating your <<otherworldly-patron>> to regain expended spell slots. You can
spend 1 minute entreating your <<otherworldly-patron>> for aid to regain all your
expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do
so again.

[[eldritch-invocations-1]]
==== Eldritch Invocations

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn
it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its
prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

===== Book of Ancient Secrets

_Prerequisite: <<pact-of-the-tome>> feature_

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two
1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list
(the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book
and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of
Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't
cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some
other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if
it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of
Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the
spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded
up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each
level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50
gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is
on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on
subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration

creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that
creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

[[otherworldly-patrons]]
==== Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of
other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power.
Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively
freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other
patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each
other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

[[the-fiend]]
===== The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a
being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such
beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately
including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon
lords, archdevils, and pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty.

[[expanded-spell-list]]
====== Expanded Spell List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn
a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell
list for you.

.Fiend Expanded Spells
[format="csv",options="header",grid="none"]
|=================================
include::./tables/warlock-fiend.csv[]
|=================================

[[dark-ones-blessing]]
====== Dark One's Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
your warlock level (minimum of 1).

[[dark-ones-own-luck]]
====== Dark One's Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your
favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use
this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the
initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

[[fiendish-resilience]]
====== Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a
short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you
choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.

[[hurl-through-hell]]
====== Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can
use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

[[your-pact-boon]]
.Your Pact Boon
****
Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that
reflects your patron's nature.

<<pact-of-the-chain>>:: 
	Your familiar is more cunning than a typical
familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with
sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied
to <<the-fiend>>. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any
familiar form is suitable for it.

<<pact-of-the-blade>>::
	If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might
be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve <<the-fiend>>, your
weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative
flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an
ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to
look like a terrible unblinking eye.

<<pact-of-the-tome>>::
	Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged
tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the
lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded
with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore
about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of <<the-fiend>>. Or it
could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the
Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning
insanity allows you to understand and cast.
